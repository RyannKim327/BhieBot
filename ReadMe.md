### Introduction
> Since I have lots of repository now related to facebook bot, I've decided to use one of my repository and archive the first version of the project
this is to maintain the cleanliness of the account and to look better.

---
### Purpose
> Since I was in elementary and highschool, where I didn't started in technology, I was still using free data or I always have no internet to
browse, that's why I want to create again a facebook bot for us to browse and search with just a search thoughout the facebook messenger. This
would be helpful for those student who has struggles in life. They may also pin those messages if it was important to them.
